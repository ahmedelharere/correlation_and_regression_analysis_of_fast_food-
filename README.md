# FA51 - Correlation and Regression

📊 This project explores how nutritional factors predict carbohydrate content in fast food items using **correlation and regression analysis**.  
Developed as part of **FA51: Formal Analysis** at Minerva University.  

---

## 🔑 Key Highlights
- Built a **multivariate regression model** to predict carbohydrate content  
- Identified **calories, fiber, and sugar** as the strongest predictors  
- Achieved an **adjusted R² of 0.792** → model explains ~79% of variability
